# Api-Clean-VS

.Net Core API sample using Clean Architecture and Vertical Slice

Architecture implemented to isolate the Application Common Domain from each Use Case Domain.

### Use Cases

- **GetWeatherForecast**:
    Sample use case based on the sample .net API WeatherForecast.

### API

The API micro-service with the Endpoints, using minimal api endpoints mapping.

### Dependency Injection

The project uses Dependence Injection to build the container services and uses self-installers to add each Use Case on the container independently.

## Tests

- **Unit Tests**:
    Tests for each class and methods independently.

- **Integration Tests**:
    Tests for each endpoint call testing the integration of all classes and methods.
